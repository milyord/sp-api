        tracking_number (str): This is required to be provided for every package and should match with the
            trackingNumber sent for the shipment confirmation.
        status_code (str): Indicates the shipment status code of the package that provides transportation information
            for Amazon tracking systems and ultimately for the final customer.
        reason_code (str): Provides a reason code for the status of the package that will provide additional information
            about the transportation status.
        status_date_time (datetime.datetime): The date and time when the shipment status was updated. This field is
            expected to be in ISO-8601 date/time format, with UTC time zone or UTC offset. For example, 2020-07-16T23:00:00Z
            or 2020-07-16T23:00:00+01:00.
        status_location_address (Address): Address of the party.
        shipment_schedule (Union[Unset, ShipmentSchedule]): Details about the estimated delivery window.
